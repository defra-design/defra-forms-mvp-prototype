# 1. Design documentation context
The following is where the design history of Defra forms will be stored.

## 2. Our approach
One of our core design principles is to always **start with what already exists**. We believe that this is not only more efficient, but also ensures we're using components and patterns that have already been tested and proven to be effective.

- We reviewed several existing form builder used across government against their suitability to meet Defra's needs. Consequently, we decided to adapt the [XGov Digital Form Builder](https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/digital-form-builder/tree/main).
- We conducted a [heuristics evaluation of the as-is XGov form builder](https://github.com/Daniel-Da-Silveira/defra-froms-mvp1/blob/main/app/design/Iterations/heuristic-evaluation.md)
