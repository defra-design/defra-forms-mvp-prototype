## Key things we are designing for
- the ability to access the form builder and maintain the necessary standard for security

Below are the screens a form creator will see when making or editing their forms.

## Versions of the journey to finding an existing form that we have tested

### Version 2
#### Onboarding landing page

#### Onboarding - email addresss

<br> *Page with “an email input box” *

#### Onboarding - enter code page

<br> *Page with “an input box for users to type the code they receieved by email” *


## What we learned

- as defra forms will be specific to Defra users, there won't be a need straight away to ask users to manually create and sign into an account.
- it will be much more feasible and a more pleasant experience for people opening Defra forms on a daily basis to utilise single sign on processes for authentication.
- having the details about who created and last edited a form was found to be benificial to ensuring correct ownership and logging of activity. However, users found it difficult to find forms a list that very long and without any form of filtering

## What we learned

The following gaps were identified:
- Anyone could access the forms which could pose security and data protections risks.
