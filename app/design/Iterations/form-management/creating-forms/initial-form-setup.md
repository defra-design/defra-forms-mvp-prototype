# Initial form setup

## Key things we are designing for
- the ability to setup a new form by first adding necessary background information about it so that someone that didn't create it will be able to view that information later

<br>

## Versions of the journey to setting up a new form

### Version 3

#### Forms sme/policy details page
![form library](/app/design/assets/policy-sme-v2.png)
<br> *Page with “an input box that only asks for a team name rather than the name and email of a person” *

## What we learned
- this overcome the data protection concerns from version 2

### Version 2

#### Forms name page

<br> *Page with “an text input box to enter a form name” *

#### Forms sme/policy details page
![form library](/app/design/assets/policy-sme-v1.png)
<br> *Page with “text input boxes for sme/policy details” *

#### Forms lead organisation details
![form library](/app/design/assets/lead-organisation-v1.png)
<br> *Page with “radio buttons to choose a lead organisation” *

## What we learned
- the ability to add such details and connect them to specific forms gave content designers more confidence and assurance that if they went on leave or they needed to delegate tasks that people would have needed details
- data privacy concerns were raised with taking the names of sme/policy details and so will need to be removed and only ask for team name

### Version 1

#### Form designer landing page

<br> *Page that shows a radio button selected to create a new form” *

#### Form name page

![XGov find an existing form journey screenshot 1](/app/design/assets/initial-form-setup-name-v1.jpeg)
<br> *Page that shows a small input box for entering a form name” *

## What we learned

The following gaps were identified:
- form ownership
- content designers emphasised the need for them to connect forms to a lead organisation (e.g., APHA)
- they also emphasised the need to add SME and policy details for each newly created form
- the input box was too small for the number of characters usually needed for forms
